        COVID-19 and pandemic.

      <h1 class="is-size-3 title">What is Coronavirus?</h1>
      <p class="is-size-5 mb-5">
        Coronavirus is a family of viruses that are known to inflicts diseases
        such as common cold to more serious respiratory illness such as the SARs
        and MERs that have once terrorize humanity back in 2003 and 2013
        respectively.
      </p>
      <p class="is-size-5 mb-5">
        Coronavirus nowadays are usually referred to the newly emerged novel
        coronavirus (nCov) that are causing the pandemic since the early 2019's.
        The disease caused by the novel coronavirus is known globally as
        COVID-19, which is a portmanteau for Coronavirus Disease 2019.
      </p>
      <p class="is-size-5 mb-5">
        As of the time of editing this article, which is 21st June of 2021, the
        death toll has reached a whopping 3.8 million worldwide. It is indeed
        disheartening to witness the mass massacre happening right here and then
        for almost 2 years.

      <h1 class="is-size-3 title">
        What we can do to prevent and stop the chain?
      </h1>
      <p class="is-size-5 mb-5">
        There are a couple of things we actually can do to avoid being infected
        and stop the chain altogether.
      </p>

      <h2 class="is-size-4 title">Cover Face with Face mask</h2>
      <p class="is-size-5 mb-5">
        Always wear a face mask when heading out to the public. Coronavirus are
        spread mainly through respiratory droplets produced by infected
        individuals through sneezing, coughing or even breathing. Hence, face
        masks helps protecting yourself and others as it acts as a layer of
        interception that can filter and block harmful particles from being
        inhaled. However, do note that there is still a risk of being infected
        while wearing a mask, but the risk have been significantly reduced
        compared to not wearing at all. Wearing a face mask can help protect
        peoples around you in case you are infected but is asymptomatic by
        preventing respiratory droplets produced from propagating through the
        air and infecting others.
      </p>

      <h2 class="is-size-4 title">Social Distancing</h2>
      <p class="is-size-5 mb-5">
        Wearing mask alone is not enough to combat the virus. It must be paired
        with other safety precaution as well to maximize the effectiveness of
        it. Social distancing must be practised all the time especially in the
        indoor settings. Avoid places that are too small or too crowded that
        social distancing is practically impossible.
      </p>

      <h2 class="is-size-4 title">Wash Hands Frequently and Effectively</h2>
      <p class="is-size-5 mb-5">
        Wash hands regularly whenever you can especially out at the public as
        our hands might unknowingly touched the surface that is contaminated by
        the virus such as escalator handle, lift buttons, door knobs, seats and
        tables. Handwashing with soap in a proper way will removes any hazardous
        substance in general that may be detrimental to our health.
      </p>

      <h2 class="is-size-4 title">Staying at Home</h2>
      <p class="is-size-5 mb-5">
        Do not go out unless necessary. Staying at home during this pandemic not
        only helps protecting yourself and family members, it also helps the
        medical front-liners to ease their work load of treating COVID patients
        by slowing or cut off the transmission chain.
      </p>
      <p class="is-size-5 mb-5">
        If travelling is necessary and inevitable, one's have to take
        precautionary measures seriously to keep yourself as safe as possible.
        Do adhere to the rules promulgated by the authority and be responsible
        and considerate to others while travelling. Return home once the errand
        is fulfilled.
      </p>

      <h2 class="is-size-4 title">Get Vaccinated</h2>
      <p class="is-size-5 mb-5">
        Perhaps one of the most compelling way to nip COVID-19 of the bud is
        through the global vaccination movement. By achieving herd immunity, the
        spread of the disease by transmission from human to human becomes harder
        and unlikely.
      </p>
      <p class="is-size-5 mb-5">
        Take Taiwan for example, Taiwan is exemplary when it comes to handling
        the whole pandemic situation since the outbreak. However, Taiwan's case
        began to surge at around May 10th this year, to a all-time-high of 723
        new cases on 22th May. This is because the vaccination movement in
        Taiwan is lackluster before the outbreak. This clearly shows that even
        though an area that is "COVID-free", an outbreak may surprise you any
        time soon if the population is not vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p class="is-size-5 mb-5">
        Though vaccination may not guarentee complete immunity to COVID-19, it
        drastically reduces the development of severe symptoms that might cause
        lifetime damage or even death. You will most likely feel like only
        catching a cold if you had contracted with the disease.
      </p>

    <div class="info__wrapper__section mb-6">
      <h1 class="is-size-3 title">Symptoms</h1>
      <p class="is-size-5 mb-5">
        The common symptoms of COVID-19 includes cough, fever, shortness of
        breath and in extreme cases, pneumonia, chest pain, loss of speech or
        movement and breathing difficulties may occur. If you are experiencing
        any of the severe symptoms above, seek for medical treatment IMMEDIATELY
        at hospitals of your vicinity.
      </p>

      <p class="is-size-5 mb-5">
        Less common symptoms but also require close attention includes
      </p>

      <ul class="is-size-5 mb-5">
        <li>Body aches and pains</li>
        <li>Sore throat</li>
        <li>Diarrhoea</li>
        <li>Conjunctivitis</li>
        <li>Headache</li>
        <li>Loss of taste or smell</li>
        <li>Skin rash</li>
        <li>Discoloration of finger and toes</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="is-size-5 mb-5">
        If you are sneezing and you suspect that you have COVID-19, please calm
        down. According to an article at Covid Symptom Study, sneezing is not
        normally a sign of COVID-19. It might just be seasonal allergies that is
        affecting you. HOWEVER, sneezing COULD indicate that you have COVID-19
        if you have been vaccinated according to study done by ZOE COVID
        research. No matter what, It's the best to cover our face and avoid
        sneezing openly to the air.
